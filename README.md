# Stack Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Stack data structure in C++.

## Description

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This project provides a step-by-step implementation of a Stack, including various operations like push, pop, and peek.

## Features

- Push elements onto the stack
- Pop elements from the stack
- Peek at the top element of the stack
- Includes time complexity analysis

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stack-implementation.git
